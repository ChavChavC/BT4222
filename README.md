# Filepath Description

## CNN-LSTM-Attn

## dataset/
Contains the processed dataset(s) that the team used for model training.

## experiments/
Contains the various experiments that the team ran while trying to test out different features for the machine learning model pipeline.

# File Description

## saved models/models_desc.txt
Contains the link to our final models and vectorizer (for feature engineering).

## Simple_ML_Models.ipynb
Contains all the experiments done on models from the sklearn library. These include experiments to test out different classification models, hyperparameter fine-tuning, and model aggregation algorithms. The findings here form the basis for many of the decisions made regarding the final model architecture.

## Final_Model.ipynb
Contains data pre-processing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter fine-tuning, and model testing pipeline. It is a summary of what we have found to be the most effective in each aspect of the pipeline. It also does the final evaluation of our final model using the test data. 

## error_analysis.ipynb
The file performs error analysis on a machine learning model to gain insights into its performance. The analysis includes visualizations such as word clouds and the percentage of wrongly predicted values.
